# acme-web-design
Hello everybody.  
This project is made according to the [acme web page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm6CUkswsNw) .  
I have watched the video and try to do same page. But I have branches on github.[see my branches](https://github.com/feridunAKYOL/acme-web-design/branches)
in this project I aim to overview HTML and CSS lessons.
The other important thing what I have learned is about `GITHUB` , `Gitkraken`, `pull request`, `push`, `branches`...
When working on a project you should make some branches to save your positions, otherwise you may lose your way in the project :smiley:  
After I have watched the video, I have done some exercises. I have diffuculties, especially over `grid`, `positioning elements`..  
I advise you the same way.
you can practice in
