# acme-web-design
Hello everybody.
this project is made according to the [acme web page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm6CUkswsNw)..
I have watched the video and try to do same page. But I have branches on github.
in this project I try to overview HTML and CSS lessons.
the other important thing what I have learned is about ' GITHUB', Gitkraken, pull request, push, branches...
